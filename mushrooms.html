<p>When you collect edible fungi, your expertise in identification is all that keeps you from <strong>death or serious illness</strong>. There’s a daredevil side to it, a sense of repeatedly staking your life against terrifying possibilities. Today’s vogue for wild foods, spurred in part by famous foraging chefs and a nostalgic desire to reconnect with the natural world, has resulted in some popular guides that feature a selection of edible and poisonous species. Nick thinks they are irresponsible, even dangerous. ‘‘They don’t explain the full range of things you might be running into,’’ he warns. Many toxic fungi closely resemble edible ones, and differentiating each from each requires careful examination, dogged determination and the inspection of spores stained and measured under a microscope slide.

<p>Puzzling out tricky specimens is satisfying in itself: If you call on Nick the evening after a fungus expedition, you will find him at a table spread with fungi, several frighteningly expensive volumes on mycological identification, a microscope and a magnifying lens, wearing an expression of joyous, fierce concentration. ‘‘For some species, the colors are unbelievably variable,’’ Nick says of one group, the <strong>russulas</strong>, ‘‘and they get washed out by rain, and then the exact distribution of the warts on the spores is an alternative. So you’re doomed, as an ordinary citizen. Because the colors won’t do it, and you haven’t got a powerful enough microscope.
