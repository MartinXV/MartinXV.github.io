    <h2>My Background</h2>

<p>My background in IT and web development isn't that great. When it comes to technology my main experience comes from learning things in order to do something on my computer. But the rest of my experience comes from taking a computer repair course for mulitple years in high school and making a web page for that class.</p>

    <h2>My Interests in Web Development</h2>
<p>My interests in web development lie in that I want to improve on the skills that I learned when I made that web page for a class many years ago. I also wish to retain the knowledge that I lost in the 6 years of not doing html.</p>

    <h2>My Extra- Curricular Intersts, Sports or Hobbies</h2>

<p>As of right now I don't have many extra curricular activities due to time. But my main interest would be computer building and improving my current rig. Besides that I am a fan of soccer and watch games whenever I get the chance to.</p>

    <h2>What I hope to Gain from this Course.... besides 4 credits</h2>
<p>I hope to gain knowledge that will help me in future jobs as well as giving me knowledge in fixing issues that are not work related.</p>

    <h2>Topics or Ideas I would Like to Dusciss and Learn About</h2>
<p>I would like to learn the most efficient way to code or things that I should generally avoid in order to make my code easy for someone else to read or improve on.</p>
